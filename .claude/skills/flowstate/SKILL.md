# Flowstate Sprint Workflow

This project uses the Flowstate sprint process. When the user says "go" (or any variation like "start", "next sprint", "continue"), follow this workflow.

## File Locations

- **Flowstate dir**: `~/.flowstate/sow-what/`
- **Config**: `~/.flowstate/sow-what/flowstate.config.md` (quality gates, agent strategy)
- **Baselines**: `~/.flowstate/sow-what/metrics/baseline-sprint-N.md`
- **Retrospectives**: `~/.flowstate/sow-what/retrospectives/sprint-N.md`
- **Metrics**: `~/.flowstate/sow-what/metrics/`
- **Metrics collection**: Use `mcp__flowstate__collect_metrics` MCP tool
- **Progress**: `~/.flowstate/sow-what/progress.md` (operational state for next session)
- **Decisions**: `~/.flowstate/sow-what/decisions-pending.md` (ambiguities logged during sprints)
- **Roadmap**: `docs/ROADMAP.md` (in this repo -- create if missing)
- **Skills**: `.claude/skills/` (in this repo)
- **Mission Control slug**: `flowstate` (used for MCP calls to update project dashboard)

## How to Determine the Next Sprint

1. If no `docs/ROADMAP.md` exists, this is Sprint 0 (see below).
2. Read `docs/ROADMAP.md` -- find the first phase not marked done.
3. Find the highest-numbered baseline in `~/.flowstate/sow-what/metrics/` -- that's your sprint number.
4. Read that baseline for starting state and gate commands.

---

## Sprint 0: Project Setup (planning only -- no code)

Sprint 0 produces the roadmap, baseline, and conventions that all future sprints depend on. No application code is written. It still gets full metrics tracking.

**Phase 1+2: RESEARCH then PLAN**

Read these files:
- `PRD.md` (fully -- every section)
- `~/.flowstate/sow-what/flowstate.config.md`
- All files in `.claude/skills/`

Then do ALL of the following:

1. **Verify gate commands.** Run each gate command from `~/.flowstate/sow-what/flowstate.config.md`. If any don't work (wrong tool, missing dependency), update them in CLAUDE.md AND in `~/.flowstate/sow-what/flowstate.config.md`. Record what works and what doesn't.

2. **Create `docs/ROADMAP.md`.**
   - Break PRD milestones into sprint-sized phases. Each phase = one sprint.
   - Right-sizing guide: a phase should be deliverable in 10-60 minutes of active agent time, produce 500-2500 LOC, and have a clear "done" state that gates can verify.
   - Phases that are mostly research or refactoring will be smaller. Phases that build new features from scratch will be larger.
   - Budget for test code: tests are typically 40-50% of total LOC. A 1000-LOC feature is really ~1500-2000 LOC with tests.
   - Number phases starting from 1 (Sprint 0 is this planning sprint).
   - Include a "Current State" section at the top (tests, coverage, LOC, milestone status).

3. **Fill in the Conventions section** in `CLAUDE.md`:
   - Language, framework, test runner
   - Lint rules and coverage floors
   - Coding standards specific to this stack
   - Any constraints from the PRD (e.g., "no .unwrap() on network data", "strict mode")
   - Known issues and gotchas discovered during gate verification

4. **Set up permissions** in `.claude/settings.json`:
   - If the file already exists, merge the `permissions` key into it (preserve existing hooks, env, etc.)
   - If it doesn't exist, create it
   - Required permissions block:
     ```json
     {
       "permissions": {
         "allow": [
           "mcp__acp__Bash",
           "mcp__acp__Edit",
           "mcp__acp__Write"
         ]
       }
     }
     ```
   - This allows future sprints to run without manual permission approval

5. **Write the initial baseline** at `~/.flowstate/sow-what/metrics/baseline-sprint-1.md`:
   - Current git SHA, test count (0 if greenfield), coverage status
   - Gate commands and whether each passes right now

6. **Commit**: `git add -A && git commit -m "sprint 0: project setup"`

7. **Pause for human review.** The roadmap is the foundation — if it's wrong, every sprint builds on a bad plan. Say: "Sprint 0 complete. Review the roadmap at `docs/ROADMAP.md` and the baseline, then say 'go' to continue." Wait for the human before proceeding to Phase 3.

**Phase 3: SHIP**

Sprint 0's Phase 3 follows the same steps as all sprints but with these differences:
- `tests_total`: 0 (or current count if pre-existing)
- `tests_added`: 0
- `coverage_pct`: null
- `loc_added`: LOC from git diff --stat (roadmap, baseline, conventions -- not application code)
- `gates_first_pass`: null (no code gates to run)
- `gates_first_pass_note`: "planning sprint -- no code gates"

Then follow the Phase 3: SHIP steps below (skip steps that Sprint 0 already completed).

---

## Phase 1+2: THINK then EXECUTE (Sprint 1+)

Read these files first:
- `PRD.md`
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` (find this sprint's phase)
- The current baseline (see above)
- `~/.flowstate/sow-what/progress.md` (if exists -- operational state from last session)
- `~/.flowstate/sow-what/flowstate.config.md`
- The previous sprint's retro (if exists)
- All files in `.claude/skills/`

### Scope Check (do this FIRST)

Read the roadmap phase for this sprint. Estimate: how many source files will be created or modified?
- If ≤5 files AND no new external dependencies: use **LIGHT MODE**.
  Skip Gherkin, skip formal wave planning. List what you'll build, implement directly, run `/gate` continuously.
- If >5 files OR new external dependencies: use **FULL MODE** (continue below).

### Feasibility Check (both modes)

- List every new external dependency this sprint requires (libraries, APIs, services)
- For each: verify it exists in the registry, check version compatibility, confirm the API you need is available
- Identify the single highest-risk technical task. Run a minimal spike (import, compile, call the API) to confirm it works
- If any dependency is unverified or experimental, FLAG IT NOW with a fallback plan. If no fallback exists, log as `[BLOCKING]` in `~/.flowstate/sow-what/decisions-pending.md` and pause for human input.
- If the spike fails, revise the scope before proceeding. If the revision changes what the sprint delivers, log the decision to `~/.flowstate/sow-what/decisions-pending.md`.
- Confirm a formatter AND linter are configured as gates in `~/.flowstate/sow-what/flowstate.config.md`. If either is missing, set one up now.

### THINK (FULL MODE)

Write your implementation plan directly (do NOT use Claude Code's plan mode — permissions are already set). Consider all skill perspectives (PM, UX, Architect):

1. Write acceptance criteria in Gherkin format for the phase scope. Every requirement must have at least one happy-path and one failure/edge-case scenario.
2. Produce an implementation plan grouped by file dependency (tasks sharing no files can be parallel).
3. For each task: files to read, files to write.

### Multi-Agent Strategy (FULL MODE)

Document your strategy choice in the plan:
- **Sequential (default):** Implement in the main session. Best when files reference each other or total LOC < 800.
- **Subagents:** Use `Task` tool with `isolation: "worktree"` for 2-3 independent packages that share no files. Each subagent gets its own copy of the repo.
- **Teams:** Use `TeamCreate` + named teammates for large sprints (1200+ LOC) with 3+ genuinely independent workstreams.

### Test Labeling

Label tests honestly by what they actually verify:
- **Unit test**: tests a single function/module in isolation, mocks external dependencies.
- **Integration test**: tests composition of multiple modules or stages together. Proves they connect correctly.
- **End-to-end test**: starts the system in its actual deployment configuration, sends input through the real entry point, asserts output through the real exit point. Runs against a live (or realistic) environment, not mocked stages.

Do NOT call a one-shot integration test "end-to-end" — this creates false confidence. If a system runs continuously (pipelines, servers, watchers), an E2E test must run it continuously too.

### EXECUTE

Implement:
- Run `/gate` after every meaningful change -- not batch-at-end
- Commit atomically after completing logical units of work
- If any gate fails: classify as REGRESSION (test existed before) or FEATURE (new test), fix, re-run, max 3 cycles
- Save gate output to `~/.flowstate/sow-what/metrics/sprint-N-gates.log`
- Optional preventive gates (run after core gates pass, if Flowstate repo is available):
  - `bash "${FLOWSTATE_REPO:-$HOME/Sites/Flowstate}"/tools/deps_check.sh` (verify new deps exist in registry)
  - `bash "${FLOWSTATE_REPO:-$HOME/Sites/Flowstate}"/tools/sast_check.sh` (static security analysis)
  - `bash "${FLOWSTATE_REPO:-$HOME/Sites/Flowstate}"/tools/deadcode_check.sh` (detect unused exports/deps)

When all gates pass, **proceed directly to Phase 3** — do not pause for human approval.

### Pipeline Buffering Convention

If any script outputs to stdout in a pipeline (pipes to another process), it must flush after every line. Without explicit flush, stdout is block-buffered (~4KB) when piped — messages stall between stages until the buffer fills or the process exits. One-shot tests mask this because process exit flushes all buffers.

| Language | Unbuffered stdout |
|----------|-------------------|
| Python | `print(..., flush=True)` or `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` or `python -u` |
| Bash | Use `stdbuf -oL script.sh` or write via python. Avoid bare `printf` in pipes |
| Ruby | `$stdout.sync = true` or `STDOUT.flush` after each write |
| Perl | `$\| = 1` (set autoflush on current output handle) |
| Node.js | `process.stdout` is unbuffered by default (not affected) |
| Go | `fmt.Println` to os.Stdout is unbuffered. `bufio.Writer` requires explicit `Flush()` |
| C | `setlinebuf(stdout)` or `fflush(stdout)` after each write |
| Rust | `io::stdout().flush()` or `BufWriter` with explicit flush |

---

## Phase 3: SHIP

1. **Collect metrics** using Flowstate MCP tools:
   - Call `mcp__flowstate__sprint_boundary` with project_path and sprint_marker to find the boundary timestamp
   - Call `mcp__flowstate__list_sessions` with project_path to find the session ID(s) for this sprint
   - Call `mcp__flowstate__collect_metrics` with project_path, session_ids, and the boundary timestamp as "after"
   - Save the raw metrics response to `~/.flowstate/sow-what/metrics/sprint-N-metrics.json`

2. **Write import JSON** at `~/.flowstate/sow-what/metrics/sprint-N-import.json`:
   - Start from the MCP metrics response (`sprint-N-metrics.json`) as the base
   - Add these fields:
     ```json
     {
       "project": "sow-what",
       "sprint": N,
       "label": "SW SN",
       "phase": "[phase name from roadmap]",
       "metrics": {
         "...everything from sprint-N-metrics.json...",
         "tests_total": "<current test count>",
         "tests_added": "<tests added this sprint>",
         "coverage_pct": "<current coverage % or null>",
         "lint_errors": 0,
         "gates_first_pass": "<true|false>",
         "gates_first_pass_note": "<note if false, empty string if true>",
         "loc_added": "<LOC from git diff --stat>",
         "loc_added_approx": false,
         "task_type": "<feature|bugfix|refactor|infra|planning|hardening>",
         "rework_rate": "<from sprint-N-metrics.json, or null>",
         "judge_score": "<[scope, test_quality, gate_integrity, convention, diff_hygiene] 1-5 each, or null>",
         "judge_blocked": "<true if judge prevented stopping, false otherwise, or null>",
         "judge_block_reason": "<reason string if blocked, or null>",
         "coderabbit_issues": "<number of CodeRabbit issues on PR, or null>",
         "coderabbit_issues_valid": "<number human agreed were real, or null>",
         "mutation_score_pct": "<mutation score if run, or null>",
         "delegation_ratio_pct": "<from sprint-N-metrics.json — subagent tokens / total tokens %, or null if no subagents>",
         "orchestrator_tokens": "<from sprint-N-metrics.json>",
         "subagent_tokens": "<from sprint-N-metrics.json>",
         "context_compressions": "<from sprint-N-metrics.json — number of context compression events>"
       }
     }
     ```
   - The schema matches `sprints.json` entries exactly -- same field names, same types
   - Validate: call `mcp__flowstate__import_sprint` with dry_run=true
   - Fix any errors before proceeding. Warnings (auto-corrections) are ok.

3. **Write retrospective** at `~/.flowstate/sow-what/retrospectives/sprint-N.md`:
   - What was built (deliverables, test count, files changed, LOC)
   - Metrics comparison vs previous sprint (see baseline)
   - What worked / what failed, with evidence

   **Sprints 1-8 (establishing)** — full retro:
   - Quality audit: check these 4 fixed instructions for compliance.
     These are mechanically verifiable -- grep the new/modified source files for evidence.
     a. TESTS EXIST: every new source file has a corresponding test file with at least 1 test.
        PASS: test file exists and covers new code. FAIL: new source file with no tests.
     b. NO SECURITY ANTI-PATTERNS: no eval(), new Function(), or unescaped template
        literals in user-facing paths in new/modified code.
        PASS: grep returns empty. FAIL: grep finds matches in non-test files.
     c. COVERAGE DID NOT REGRESS: compare current coverage % to baseline.
        PASS: coverage >= baseline. FAIL: coverage dropped.
     d. PRODUCTION SHAPE TESTED: if any new/modified component has a long-running mode
        (--watch, --daemon, --serve, polling loop, persistent connection, piped pipeline),
        at least one test starts it as a background process, sends real input, and verifies
        output arrives within a bounded wait (e.g., 10 seconds).
        PASS: background/continuous test exists for each long-running component, OR N/A (no long-running components).
        FAIL: all tests use one-shot/exit mode for a component meant to run continuously.
     For each, quote file:line evidence.
   - Skill relevance audit: review each skill file (.claude/skills/*.md). For each rule, classify as USED (cite the decision) or UNUSED. If a rule has been UNUSED for 4+ consecutive sprints, flag as STALE CANDIDATE.
   - Change proposals as diffs (with `- Before` / `+ After` blocks). Prefer REMOVING or SIMPLIFYING instructions over adding new ones.

   **Sprints 9+ (mature)** — slim retro:
   - If gates passed first try and coverage did not regress: write "No retro issues — gates passed, conventions held." Skip the quality audit, skill audit, and change proposals.
   - If a gate failed or coverage regressed: include the quality audit (4 checks above) and a change proposal ONLY for what broke. Still skip the skill relevance audit.

4. **Carry learnings forward:**
   - **Skill/convention change proposals** (modifying `.claude/skills/*.md` or `CLAUDE.md`): Do NOT apply. These stay in the retro for human review. Auto-Continue will pause if any exist.
   - **Operational learnings** ("this test pattern worked", "avoid X with this framework", "this API has a quirk"): Write these into `~/.flowstate/sow-what/progress.md` under a "Learnings" section. The next sprint subagent reads progress.md and inherits them automatically.

5. **Commit**: `git add -A && git commit -m "sprint N: [description]"`

6. **Update Mission Control** (if `mcp__mission_control__update_project_status` is available):
   - Call `mcp__mission_control__update_project_status` with:
     - `slug`: `flowstate`
     - `status`: "running" (or "complete" if this was the last phase in the roadmap)
     - `next_step`: what the next sprint will build (from roadmap), or "Deploy and configure" if roadmap is done
   - Call `mcp__mission_control__update_step` for the just-completed phase:
     - `slug`: `flowstate`
     - `step_title`: the phase title (match it to the step in Mission Control)
     - `status`: "done"
   - If the MCP server is unreachable, log a warning and continue — this is best-effort, never blocking.

7. **Write next baseline** at `~/.flowstate/sow-what/metrics/baseline-sprint-{N+1}.md`:
   - Current git SHA, test count, coverage %, lint error count
   - Gate commands and current status
   - Quality audit uses the 4 fixed instructions above -- no rotation needed

8. **Update roadmap**: mark this phase done in `docs/ROADMAP.md`, update Current State section

9. **Write progress file** at `~/.flowstate/sow-what/progress.md`:
   - **First, read the existing `~/.flowstate/sow-what/progress.md`** (if it exists) to extract the accumulated Learnings section. Do not skip this step — learnings compound across sprints and losing them degrades future sprint quality.
   - Then write the new progress.md with:
     - What was completed this sprint (list of deliverables)
     - What failed or was deferred (and why)
     - What the next session should do first
     - Any blocked items or external dependencies awaiting resolution
     - Current gate status (all passing? which ones?)
     - **Learnings** (accumulated): copy ALL prior learnings from the old progress.md, then append new ones from this sprint. Patterns that worked, pitfalls to avoid, framework quirks. This section only grows — never remove entries unless they're proven wrong.
   This is operational state for the next agent session, not analysis.

10. **Completion check** -- print this checklist with [x] or [MISSING] for each:
   - `~/.flowstate/sow-what/metrics/sprint-N-metrics.json` exists (raw MCP metrics response)
   - `~/.flowstate/sow-what/metrics/sprint-N-import.json` exists (complete import-ready JSON, validated via MCP dry_run)
   - `~/.flowstate/sow-what/retrospectives/sprint-N.md` contains:
     - Deliverables, metrics comparison, what worked/failed
     - **Sprints 1-8**: quality audit (4 checks), skill relevance audit, change proposal (or "no changes needed")
     - **Sprints 9+**: "No retro issues" line if gates passed first try, OR quality audit + change proposal for what broke
   - `~/.flowstate/sow-what/metrics/baseline-sprint-{N+1}.md` exists with SHA, tests, coverage, gates
   - `~/.flowstate/sow-what/progress.md` written (current state for next session)
   - `docs/ROADMAP.md` updated (phase marked done, Current State refreshed)
   - Sprint code committed
   - Mission Control updated (status + step marked done), or "MCP unavailable" if server unreachable
   Fix any MISSING items before declaring done.

**This sprint is now complete.** If you are running as a subagent, return control to the orchestrator. Do NOT proceed to Auto-Continue — that section runs ONLY in the main orchestrator session.

---

## Auto-Continue (orchestrator only — do NOT run this in a sprint subagent)

After Phase 3 completes, check whether to continue:

1. Read `docs/ROADMAP.md`. Is there a next phase not marked done?
   - **No** → All phases complete. Update Mission Control: `mcp__mission_control__update_project_status` with slug="flowstate", status="complete". Say "Roadmap complete. N sprints run." and stop.
   - **Yes** → Continue to step 2.

2. Check the retro just written. Does it contain change proposals (diffs with `- Before` / `+ After`)?
   - **Yes** → Pause. Say "Sprint N complete. Retro has change proposals — review before continuing." Show the proposals. Wait for human.
   - **No** → Continue to step 3.

3. Check `~/.flowstate/sow-what/decisions-pending.md`. If it has 5+ unresolved decisions, or any marked `[BLOCKING]`, pause and present them to the human for review.

4. **Milestone checkpoint (infrastructure projects).** If the just-completed sprint finishes a milestone (all phases in that milestone are now done) AND the project has infrastructure components (Docker, networking, services, long-running pipelines), pause for human smoke-testing. Say: "Milestone MN complete. Infrastructure projects need human smoke-testing before continuing. Verify the deployment works end-to-end, then say 'go' to continue." Feature-only projects (no infrastructure) skip this check.

5. **Auto-import metrics.** Before launching the next sprint, import the just-completed sprint's metrics so they aren't lost if the session ends unexpectedly:
   - Validate: call `mcp__flowstate__import_sprint` with the import JSON path and `dry_run=true`
   - If valid: call `mcp__flowstate__import_sprint` with `dry_run=false` to write to sprints.json
   - If validation fails: log a warning in progress.md but don't block — the human can import manually later

6. **Launch the next sprint as a subagent.** Use `Task` with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` and `mode: "bypassPermissions"`. Pass a prompt containing:
   - The project path and `~/.flowstate/sow-what` path
   - "Read `.claude/skills/flowstate/SKILL.md`. Run Sprint N+1: Phase 1+2 (THINK then EXECUTE) and Phase 3 (SHIP)."
   - "Read `~/.flowstate/sow-what/progress.md` for handoff state and accumulated learnings from previous sprints."
   - "Stop after the Phase 3 completion check. Do NOT run Auto-Continue."

   **Architecture rules:**
   - Each sprint subagent runs exactly ONE sprint (Phase 1+2+3) and returns
   - The subagent reads state from files (progress.md, baseline, roadmap) and writes state to files (progress.md, baseline, retro, metrics)
   - Auto-Continue runs ONLY here in the orchestrator — never inside a subagent
   - This keeps nesting flat (max 2 levels: orchestrator → sprint subagent) and prevents unbounded recursion

   When the subagent completes, read the updated `~/.flowstate/sow-what/progress.md` and `docs/ROADMAP.md`, then repeat from step 1.

   **Why subagents:** Each sprint consumes ~270K new-work tokens. Running multiple sprints in the same context window causes degradation. Fresh context per sprint keeps quality consistent. Learnings propagate via progress.md — the subagent reads prior learnings at the start, appends new ones at the end.

## Decision Batching

When you encounter an ambiguity or design question during a sprint:

1. **Don't block.** Pick the most reasonable default and continue.
2. **Log it.** Append to `~/.flowstate/sow-what/decisions-pending.md`:
   ```
   ### Sprint N — [short description]
   **Question**: [what's ambiguous]
   **Default chosen**: [what you went with and why]
   **Impact if wrong**: [what would need to change]
   **Status**: PENDING
   ```
   Mark as `[BLOCKING]` only if no safe default exists and continuing would waste significant work.
3. **Keep building.** The human reviews pending decisions at natural checkpoints (see Auto-Continue step 3) or when a `[BLOCKING]` decision forces a pause.

Decisions that are NOT ambiguities (don't log these):
- Implementation details with one obvious answer
- Library/API choices where one clearly fits
- Code structure that follows established project patterns

Decisions that ARE ambiguities (log these):
- Product behavior the PRD doesn't specify ("should this be a modal or a page?")
- Trade-offs between conflicting requirements
- Scope questions ("the PRD says X but that implies Y — should we build Y too?")
- External dependency choices with no clear winner
